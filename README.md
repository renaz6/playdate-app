# playdate-app

This is a mobile application built using Swift. 
The app  simplifies the process of finding local live theatre and arts events to attend by providing users with the ability to conveniently see 
a list of live events and art exhibits happening nearby, along with showtimes and locations. The user is able to transition between four 
different categories of events: theatre, comedy, art, and misc.  
Selecting a certain show name in the list allows the user to be redirected to the event’s detail page, where they will be able to find more information about 
the event and links to purchase tickets, if applicable. 
If the user is interested in a specific event, they can save it in their favorites, so that they can easily access the event’s page at a later time.
